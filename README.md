# BroKinAlphaBet  
**A Cross-LLM Creative Intelligence Engine**

BroKinAlphaBet is a modular AI orchestration platform where multiple large language models (LLMs) collaborate in creative loopsâ€”refining, mutating, and challenging each other across distinct cognitive roles.

This project enables a new class of recursive AI tools powered by wallet-gated access, encrypted key storage, and zero-knowledge (ZK) commitment logic.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Multi-Model LLM Chaining**: Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, Mistral, Groq, and more  
- **Role-Based Thinking**: Creator â†’ Engineer â†’ Critic loops  
- **ZK-Bound API Key Storage** (planned)  
- **Token-Gated Access Control** (planned)  
- **Web3 Wallet Login** (planned)  
- **Secure Backend API** with `.env`-protected model calls  
- **Frontend Loop Interface** via `index.html`

## ðŸ§  Philosophy

> Let models hallucinate, reason, and reviseâ€”together.

BroKinAlphaBet isnâ€™t just a toolchain. Itâ€™s an experimental framework for collaborative, cross-AI thinkingâ€”looped and logged until emergence occurs.
